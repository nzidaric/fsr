<Abstract>

<Index Key="FSR package">&FSR; package</Index>

The &GAP; package &FSR; can be used to implement arbitrary
 LFSR, NLFSR and FILFUN objects, where FILFUN stands for ``filtering functions'.
 This package was designed based on modular
 thinking, inherent to hardware designs, and recognition and
 exploitation of structural similarities between LFSRs, NLFSRs and
 filters, from both mathematical and hardware perspectives.
 Conventional feedback functions are modelled as
 univariate or multivariate polynomials.  More complex functions can be modelled
as  FILFUNs.  Complex primitives,
such as Grain stream cipher, can be implemented
with  a set of (N)LFSRs and FILFUN filters.
 The generality of the FSR package enables the
FSRs to be used directly
as building blocks for many cryptographic modules, e.g. random number generators.
These can be executed in GAP and can
generate traces w.r.t. different bases for testbenching purposes.
