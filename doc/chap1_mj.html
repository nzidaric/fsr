<h3>1 <span class="Heading">Preface</span></h3>

<p>The <strong class="pkg">GAP</strong> package <strong class="pkg">FSR</strong> implements Feedback Shift Registers. Feedeback shift registers play an important role in stream cipher design. A well known early example of an LFSRs based stream cipher is A5/1, intended for securing GSM voice and data. A5/1 is built from three LFSRs with different periods and a stop-and-go majority function controlling their clocks. The A5/1 output is computed as <code class="code">XOR</code> of outputs from all three LFSRs. A milestone in stream cipher design is the eSTREAM project \cite{estr}, launched in 2004. All 3 hardware portfolio ciphers, Grain, MICKEY (using Galois-style feedback) and Trivium, as well as the software portfolio cipher Sosemanuk, use FSRs. Grain is presented in section \ref{grt}. The stream cipher ACORN \cite{acorn}, a remaining round 3 CAESAR candidate \cite{caesar}, is based on 6 LFSRs. Last but not least, both stream ciphers used for encryption and integrity of communications in mobile networks, Snow3G and ZUC, use LFSRs over an extension field.</p>

<p>Another application area for LFSRs are the cyclic redundancy codes (CRC) used in many communication and data storage devices for error-detection. The LFSRs have been used as counters in applications where the order of the sequence does not matter, for example Xilinx proposed the use of LFSR counters to address the RAM \cite{xilinxLFSR} (by now declared obsolete). Furthermore, LFSRs are used for pattern generation in built-in self testing for electronic circuits. % NOTE: Peterson, W. W.; Brown, D. T. (January 1961). "Cyclic Codes for Error Detection.</p>

<p>Less noticeable is the use of LFSRs in algorithms for finite field arithmetic. For example, a serial circuit that requires multiplication by <span class="SimpleMath">\(x\)</span>, followed by reduction modulo the field defining polynomial, can be implemented as an LFSR with the defining polynomial as feedback \cite{AHlec}.</p>

<h4>1.1 <span class="Heading">Some basic concepts</span></h4>

<p>An <span class="SimpleMath">\(n\)</span>-stage shift register over a finite field <span class="SimpleMath">\(\mathcal{F}\)</span> is an array of <span class="SimpleMath">\(n\)</span> registers (denoted <span class="SimpleMath">\(S_t\)</span>, <span class="SimpleMath">\(t=n-1, \ldots,0\)</span>), and each stage holds a value from the underlying finite field <span class="SimpleMath">\(\mathcal{F}\)</span>. <span class="SimpleMath">\(n\)</span> is also referred to as the length of the FSR. This memory array is shifted with each step <span class="SimpleMath">\(S_t \rightarrow S_{t-1}\)</span> for <span class="SimpleMath">\(t=n-1, \dots,1\)</span>, and the vacant register <span class="SimpleMath">\(S_{n-1}\)</span> is updated with a new value obtained from the feedback function, hence the name <code class="code">feedback shift register</code> (FSR). One of the stages is used to generate the output and each time the FSR is clocked. The chosen stage produces a new element <span class="SimpleMath">\(s_i\in\mathcal{F}\)</span>. In this way, the FSR produces a sequence of elements:<br /> <span class="SimpleMath">\(\underline{s}=\{s_k\}= s_0,s_1,s_2,\dots\)</span><br /> A simple schematic of an <span class="SimpleMath">\(n\)</span>-stage FSR shown in figure below produces the output sequence from stage <span class="SimpleMath">\(S_0\)</span>.</p>

<p><img src="fsr.jpg" align="center" /></p>

<p>The feedback function is a polynomial function in <span class="SimpleMath">\(n\)</span> variables (that correspond to the stages, i.e. variable <span class="SimpleMath">\(x_t\)</span> takes its value from the stage <span class="SimpleMath">\(S_t\)</span>):<br /> <span class="SimpleMath">\(f:\,\mathcal{F}^n \rightarrow \,\mathcal{F}\,\)</span><br /> <span class="SimpleMath">\(f(x_0,x_1,\dots,x_{n-1}) = \sum\limits_{\forall (i_0,i_1,\dots,i_{n-1}) \in Z_q^n}c_{i_0,i_1,\dots,i_{n-1}}x_0^{i_0} x_1^{i_1}\dots x_{n-1}^{i_{n-1}}\)</span><br /> with coefficients <span class="SimpleMath">\(c_{i_0,i_1,\dots,i_{n-1}}\in\mathcal{F}=\mathbb{F}_q\)</span> and where <span class="SimpleMath">\(i_t\in \mathbb{Z}_q\)</span> and <span class="SimpleMath">\(q\)</span> is a prime or a prime power and <span class="SimpleMath">\(t\in \mathbb{Z}_n\)</span>. The sum in the equation above runs over all possible monomials <span class="SimpleMath">\( x_0^{i_0}x_1^{i_1}\dots x_{n-1}^{i_{n-1}}\)</span>.</p>

<p>The degree of a monomial is defined as the sum of all its powers and the degree of the polynomial as the maximum degree of all its monomials. For readability, notation <span class="SimpleMath">\(m_{i_0,i_1,\dots,i_{n-1}}\)</span> is introduced for monomials: <span class="SimpleMath">\(m_{i_0,i_1,\dots,i_{n-1}}=m(x_0,x_1,\dots,x_{n-1})=x_0^{i_0}x_1^{i_1} \dots x_{n-1}^{i_{n-1}}\)</span>.</p>

<p><span class="SimpleMath">\({\rm Degree}(m(x_0,x_1,\dots,x_{n-1}))=\sum\limits_{t=0}^{n-1}i_t\)</span></p>

<p><span class="SimpleMath">\({\rm Degree}(f(x_0,x_1,\dots,x_{n-1}))=\max\limits_{\forall (i_0,i_1,\dots,i_{n-1})\in Z_q^n} \left\{{\rm Degree}(m_{i_0,i_1,\dots,i_{n-1}})\right\}\)</span></p>

<p>Based on the degree of the feedback polynomial, distinction is made between <code class="code">linear</code> (<code class="func">LFSR</code> (<a href="chap2_mj.html#X8099A9DC86E0B078"><span class="RefLink">2.2-1</span></a>)) and <code class="code">nonlianear</code> (<code class="func">NLFSR</code> (<a href="chap2_mj.html#X7DDE3CAC7A9D2A55"><span class="RefLink">2.3-1</span></a>)) feedback shift registers. For the linear case, the degree of the feedback polynomial is 1.</p>

<p>At any given moment, the contents of the FSR hold <span class="SimpleMath">\(n\)</span> values from the underlying finite field, and can be written as a vector of length <span class="SimpleMath">\(n\)</span>: <span class="SimpleMath">\((s_0,s_1,\dots,s_{n-1})\in\mathcal{F}^n\)</span>. This vector is called the <code class="code">state</code> of the FSR, and the state right after loading the <code class="code">initial state</code>. The output sequence <span class="SimpleMath">\(\underline{s}\)</span> is completely determined by the feedback polynomial and the initial state.</p>

<p>In case of <span class="SimpleMath">\(q=2\)</span>, <span class="SimpleMath">\(\mathcal{F}=\mathbb{F}_2\)</span>, function <span class="SimpleMath">\(f\)</span> is a boolean function and the FSR produces a binary sequence. In all other cases, the sequence is referred to as a <span class="SimpleMath">\(q\)</span>-arry sequence.</p>

<p>To keep the chapter short, details will be omitted and the reader can refer to a number of sources such as {\cite sdgc,GGbook,lidl}.</p>

<h4>1.2 <span class="Heading">Overview</span></h4>

<p>The FSR package allows creation, initialization and running of FSRs, and can compute some of their properties, such as length or internal state size. A third object called FILFUN, short for ``filtering function'' was added. A filtering function is simply a multivariate function. Because of the similarities between filtering functions and NLFSR feedbacks, the FILFUN is created as an FSR object, which allows the reuse of most NLFSR methods. The core functionality is organized into four basic parts:</p>


<ul>
<li><p>common functionality for FSRs</p>

</li>
<li><p>LFSR specific functionality</p>

</li>
<li><p>NLFSR specific functionality</p>

</li>
<li><p>FILFUN specific functionality</p>

</li>
</ul>
<p>The category of FSR objects is defined, and the FSRs can created as LFSRs, NLFSRs or FILFUNs. They are created through a function call with various possibilities for the arguments, and will return an object with four components, and some (case specific) attributes and properties. Only the values that can change during the FSRs lifetime are implemented as components:</p>


<ul>
<li><p><code class="code">init</code> - initial state of the FSR</p>

</li>
<li><p><code class="code">state</code> - the current state of the FSR</p>

</li>
<li><p><code class="code">numsteps</code> - number of steps since object was created</p>

</li>
<li><p><code class="code">basis</code> - the basis used for representation of the field elements</p>

</li>
</ul>
<p>Initial state is kept as a component because we want the ability to reload and run the same FSR without creating a new instance. Field <code class="code">init</code> is empty when the FSR is created and is updated when its loaded. The component <code class="code">state</code> is updated with each FSR step. Field <code class="code">numsteps</code> keeps track of the FRS: when created its set to -1, when loaded to 0, and then increments with each step. It is used for coding purposes to prevent an attempt of running an empty FRS and to stop the FRS once a certain threshold is reached, preventing it from looping indefinitely. The <code class="code">basis</code> field holds the current basis used for representation of elements and can be chained when needed. <br /> Please note that there is no concept of shifting and updating of the state for the FILFUNS: the components <code class="code">init</code> and <code class="code">state</code> are loaded with same initial state, which is then used to evaluate the multivariate function, i.e. compute the ``feedback''. The computed value is the output of the FILFUN. Furthermore, <code class="code">state</code> and <code class="code">numsteps</code> are not updated. <br /> The behavior of an FSR is captured with three methods:</p>


<ul>
<li><p><code class="code">LoadFSR</code> - loads the initial state</p>

</li>
<li><p><code class="code">StepFSR</code> - computes the feedback value and <br /> (i.) shifts stages, updates the vacant stage <span class="SimpleMath">\(S_{n-1}\)</span> and outputs the new sequence element in case of an (N)LFSR and <br /> (ii.) outputs the computed feedback in case of a FILFUN.</p>

</li>
<li><p><code class="code">RunFSR</code> - a sequence of <code class="code">StepFSR</code> calls (with options such as run, load and run, run for number of steps, ... available)</p>

</li>
</ul>
<p><code class="code">StepFSR</code> comes in two versions, and both are inherited by the <code class="code">RunFSR</code> as well:</p>


<ul>
<li><p>regular step - FSR self-contained</p>

</li>
<li><p>external step - adds an external element to the computed feedback value</p>

</li>
</ul>
<p>The external step and run are implemented because of their common use in cryptography. <br /> Remainder of the FSR package consists of helper functions (for example to compute the degree of the feedback polynomial), writing functions (for example to print out a sequence of LFSR steps including the state changes to a *.txt file or directly as *.tex file) and drawing functions (generating the tikz for *.tex) as is shown in figure below. <img src="testLFSRtikz.jpg" align="center" /></p>
