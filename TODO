LFSR - TO DOs
* Valid check: the current state must come from initial state in num steps !!! 
think about whether to give that  in terms of the LFSR internal state or as sequence ? \\
why we like cycles: the dont care which was the initial  state
- number of cycles (2 or more)
-length of cycles = number of different internal states in individual cycles
-cycles = return each cycle as a list of internal states in the cycle ?
